"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues . it  s full of emotion and the direction is done well . the storyline progresses very quickly  but i guess that  s better than having to watch a  hour movie . this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy .

"i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors . he has a half dozen classics to his credit . he does fine here as the heavy  but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome  it never gets off the mark . the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself . still he mugs well and carries things along . the death knell is twofold . first of all  if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another  it would eat up about a third of the movie . add to that  robertson  s character sitting up in bed in the blue light  looking confused  that might add another chunk . i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent  though insignificant film . the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that  when all is said and done  leaves incredible questions . i  m not putting in spoilers  but when it ends  don  t think too much . i can come up with ten what  ifs without raising a sweat . it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors . he has a half dozen classics to his credit . he does fine here as the heavy  but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome  it never gets off the mark . the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself . still he mugs well and carries things along . the death knell is twofold . first of all  if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another  it would eat up about a third of the movie . add to that  robertson  s character sitting up in bed in the blue light  looking confused  that might add another chunk . i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent  though insignificant film . the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that  when all is said and done  leaves incredible questions . i  m not putting in spoilers  but when it ends  don  t think too much . i can come up with ten what  ifs without raising a sweat . it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"i wasn  t alive in the    s  so i can  t guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period  but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience . there are some excellent performances  most notably by josh hamilton  of with honors   jerry o  connell  sliders   who play brothers divided by the war . bill smitrovich  a character actor who has been long ignored by many  gives a heart  filled performance as their strict father  who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside  while the other is exactly the opposite . all in all  this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience .

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"of life in  some  colleges . of course there were artistic licenses taken  but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges .  br    br   i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own . it  s funny because these are schools that want racial unity  equality etc . and i can honestly say  that it  s there . but the thing is when class lets out  or when they  re just hanging out waiting for class  they  students  seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity . is that bad  not really . everyone needs a feeling of belonging . but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that   we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them .  otherwise you  re creating your own segregation .  br    br   racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended . one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations . fortunately  nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering .  br    br   i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen .  br    br   so is  higher learning  overly dramatic  exaggerated  maybe . is it way  off mark   it depends on where you went to or go to school . the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen . minus the hollywood exaggerations  the race thing hit pretty close to home for me .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"of life in  some  colleges . of course there were artistic licenses taken  but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges .  br    br   i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own . it  s funny because these are schools that want racial unity  equality etc . and i can honestly say  that it  s there . but the thing is when class lets out  or when they  re just hanging out waiting for class  they  students  seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity . is that bad  not really . everyone needs a feeling of belonging . but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that   we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them .  otherwise you  re creating your own segregation .  br    br   racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended . one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations . fortunately  nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering .  br    br   i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen .  br    br   so is  higher learning  overly dramatic  exaggerated  maybe . is it way  off mark   it depends on where you went to or go to school . the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen . minus the hollywood exaggerations  the race thing hit pretty close to home for me .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight            via les diaboliques        while still watchable in itself  it  s so clich  ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills . however  thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late     s  even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract   star names  cliff robertson  as the conniving husband   jean simmons  in the title role   jenny agutter  as robertson  s artist half  sister   simon ward  as the enigmatic chauffeur   ron moody  as an ill  fated doctor   michael jayston  as robertson  s business partner   judy geeson  as simmons  best friend and jayston  s wife   flora robson  as the housekeeper   david tomlinson  as the notary reading simmons  will  and  most surprisingly perhaps  jack warner  as a gravestone sculptor   although most of them actually have nothing parts  i  m sorry to say

"the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u . s .  . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly  the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v . s . female  white v . s . black  and the individual v . s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself .  br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end  . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over  the  top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down  trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university . it is a life  learning process  not a textual one . i think you  ll find  higher learning  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"i saw brigadoon on tv last night    sept      . i am   years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children  s club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"i  ll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao  hsien . i . e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this isn  t quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate  s attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop  the vaguely minimalist dialogue  the slow swaying camerawork  and male leads  in particular  who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical  chekovian   i . e . very predictable  plot  the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i couldn  t help but see the  blue danube  river scene  for example  as verging on genre parody  although the smoggy looking  springtime  sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour . . .  i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant  and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of  flowers of shanghai   the film is not in the same league  visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film  i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave  and i can  t recall the last film i walked out of  . i  m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn  t care . if you  d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i  d recommend anything by the above two directors  for example  in the mood for love  or  flowers of shanghai   both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping  the former with chris doyle   and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it  s not often mr hoberman leads me astray  and perhaps you  d rather listen to him  but don  t say you weren  t warned . craig .  br    br

"not very impressed . its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film  because there is almost no development in the plot . everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . the acting seems very poor as well  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television . although this is difficult to tell with the female role  yuwen  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .  br    br   tian zhuangzhuang  s film the  blue kite  was a far better film . but don  t be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late    s . unlike the blue kite  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .  br    br   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can  t tell the difference between a film that is  beautiful   profound  or  hypnotic  and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .  br    br   if any film fits the description of  overrated   this is it . i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .

"what the movie the   s really represents  to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade . despite the exaggerated  stereotyped characters  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .  br    br   not only were those radical times of change  but also very confusing times . two basic things changed our world then the     civil rights act  and the overwhelming influence of the media . those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .  br    br   from chaos came sensitivity  from disorder came values . bear in mind however  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this . . . they worked  they played  they watched the news . . . and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities . . . the civil rights workers  the political activists  the anti  war efforts  the war on poverty . . . .  br    br   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular  was well reflected  although the conflict between the general public  s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored . . . and at worst  misrepresented . . middle class americans weren  t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats  or disowning their wayward daughters . they were confused too . let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk  protest movement . there are no beatle songs in the movie  or even any mention of them .  br    br   i think if you didn  t live the decade  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about  the overall picture is a bit dim . at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock . at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut . roles were constantly changing .  br    br   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family . they represent the hippie child  the political activist  and the active military personnel . dad represents the typical attitudes  and mom represents the voice of reason  tolerance  and sometimes compromise . . . for the sake of peace .  br    br   the black family comprises a minister and his son . . . disproportionately  i think . i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations  or else the film would have become a long  boring  documentary . dad  s message was that anger produces bitterness  and bitterness produces chaos . it was clearly a message directed to today  s youth .  br    br   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems  and also how issues divide us . . . the   s were unusual in that way  and only the roaring   s compare . in other words  this movie has a moral after all . in the end  it is our collective individualism that survives . put that in your oxymoron list .  br    br   everyone was a god  a guru  or a free  spirited genius in the   s . it was a time of magic and madness . no one will ever nail the   s down right . . . it was too diverse  this movie is close  . at least we can say we are not ashamed of it  that we learned and grew from it  and that for once  a generation shaped and changed america . . . for the better .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"this is the first of  the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare  bbc series i  ve seen  and if all of them are like this  i might watch no more . being practically the full text of the play is everything this  romeo  juliet  has going for it  lacking in all other departments . alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director  both in the technical and artistic aspects . in the former  because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid . take in consideration  for example  the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene  or the nurse  s entering of friar lawrence  s cell  asking where  s romeo with him being so very in front of her that she  d clearly see him even if she was blind . and  in the latter  because every single one of the performers is misdirected  even if some of them are good actors . rebecca saire looks exactly the way i  ve always imagined juliet to look like  and she doesn  t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager  but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind . patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse  being not only as dull as juliet  but also way too old and not even good  looking  coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll . putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other  let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written . alan rickman  in his screen debut  plays tybalt like if he was darth vader  which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended  no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings . this tybalt is so mean  looking that we don  t believe the characters  pity after his demise . as for paris  i kept thinking of  prince valium  from spaceballs . only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice .  br    br   at    minutes  this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters  because the characters don  t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles . the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli  s . but  to be fair  this bbc one isn  t nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor  s flamboyant geriatric version  or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann  s feature  length mtv video .     .

"this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in . john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece . brilliant performances by the whole cast  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star  s career .  br    br   however  as a college student myself  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme . in a sense that  while they are issues faced on many college campuses  they aren  t presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe . in some instances  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur . however  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic  the film was brilliant and left me stunned  unable to talk  just think . one of the things from this picture i will remember forever  was a quote from lawrence fishburn  s character   knowledge is power  without knowledge  you cannot see your power .  brilliant  just brilliant .

"  major payne  is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines . this film does not really have a lot to offer  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well  worth a watch . don  t expect it to be a memorable film  however . just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people . the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious  and that  s really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne . again  it is not a great film  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"one of the better kung fu movies  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  which is rarer than you  d think for this era  and make the non  fight dialogue sequences passable  for a kung fu movie  this is a great compliment  . unlike other chinese action movies  which were always period pieces or  in the wake of jackie chan  s police story i  cop dramas  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately  in the latter    of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .  br    br   the action is overall good  featuring a duel between sammo and    of the shaw brothers  only  stars  kar  leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li  s bad guy . there  s only   minutes of combat here  which is standard  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other  but there are smooth edits and then there  s this . it really takes away from the fights when it  s this obvious the footage was messed with .  br    br   that said  if you like kung fu movies  my opinion here won  t dissuade you  and if you don  t  you just wasted  minutes of your life reading this .

"french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary  everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in     of l  emploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker  s descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet l  emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production  jacques audiard  s gritty crime caper  sur mes levres  read my lips  . actually  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla  a shy  diminutive young woman sits at her desk  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .  br    br   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla  s desk to chat and drop off their half  finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend  s baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load  carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  preferably male  as if she were at a personals agency . he should be   years old and clean  cut  with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man  carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery  where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul  but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on  a furious carla asks paul  s help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock  most notably rear window  where carla  s lip  reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing  on  again  off  again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said  what one carries away from this movie isn  t so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers  although those elements are definitely there  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  in this case paris  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy  garish nightlife where sex  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it  s hitchcock with the gloves off .

"following the success of  paris  je t  aime   a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film  the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly   by the time you think are getting into a story  it  s over in too many cases . and  the often start up and stop and then begin again   with the stories woven together . as a result  there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure .  br    br   sadly  however  while  paris  je t  aime  was hit or miss  mostly hit   most of  new york  i love you  was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet   and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories   and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand  it was good quality music but its somber tone really  really made me feel like cutting my wrists  among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom  the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant  though this was also in the first film  and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much   and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn  t like it very much .  br    br   by the way  and this is not really a complaint  but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film  that was unusual in our more anti  smoking culture .  br    br   also  if you get the dvd  there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon  wearing a cool fedora  eating a hotdog . . . . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world   including a very unhappy couple .

"i can agree with other comments that there wasn  t an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn  t a documentary  it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at it .  br    br   i agree with the black family . the scenes with them seemed out of place . like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good .  br    br   despite it wasn  t a re  enactment of the   s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade . i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch .

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here . shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .  br    br   in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet . bloodshed soon erupts . . .  br    br   the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play . it  s a story that  with it  s energy  deserves to be shot outdoors . coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces . the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .  br    br   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo . he manages the character  s intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range . it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo . rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the character  s naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .  br    br   the supporting roles don  t fare much better . joseph o  connor  s friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut . anthony andrews  mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera . he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result . alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt . he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isn  t in evidence here . the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera . only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity . his capulet is well  played and a joy to watch .  br    br   see one of the other versions of this story instead .

"have to admit  this version disgraces shakespeare upfront  none can act except the nurse who was my fav  juliet had good skills as a teen but she can  t give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her . she  s worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion . . . god stop whining  i would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up  anthony andrews . . . yikes  considering his other great movies  brideshead revisited  ivanhoe  scarlet pimpernel   he  s quite a shocker in this one . and don  t get me started on romeo . . . puhleasssssee  it  s still good to see if you  re on the hunt to see every romeo and juliet ever made in the history of film . olivia and leonard  s version is still the best  followed by leslie howard  s version and then the current leo and clare

"the   s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot . in four deliveries  we follow a north american family  with  members . but we don  t only see them . we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend  an extremist student leader  and a soldier in vietnam . the filmography is just extraordinary . in the first chapters  we see some shots of the vietnam war  in between the scenes . the next chapter  doesn  t start where the last one finished  it starts some time after  giving us a little mystery on what happened . in general  the   s mini series  is a must see  not only for hippies fanatics  but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic .

"superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene  s leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of   s    s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  it  s always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnelli  s musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris .   br    br   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didn  t want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie  s innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold .  br    br   while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st . louis   the plaid  tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never  have  been locales . its whimsy doesn  t even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow  traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example  in exchange for brigadoon  s immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge .  br    br   at one point we  re assured that  everybody  s looking for their own brigadoon .  suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren  t looking for this kind of quasi  queasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief .  van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting  cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed  off van johnson performance .
